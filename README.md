Unlocking Sales Success: Your Ultimate Sales Distribution Dashboard

This project offers a powerful sales distribution dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable insights, empowering you to boost sales and streamline distribution with ease.

### Data Sources
The sales dataset contains detailed information on product sales, including product IDs, sales dates, quantities sold, prices, demographic information and customer information.
By combining data from these sources, our sales distribution dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance and distribution channel optimization, enabling data-driven decision-making.

### Tools
- Power Query Editor
  - Data Cleaning
- Microsoft PowerBI
  - Data Analysis
  - Creating Visuals
  - Format Visuals and Background

### Data Cleaning
In the Initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data transformation which include date formatting and data type conversion
3. Handling missing values
4. Data cleaning

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales distribution data to answer key questions, such as:
- What are the sales trends?
- Which products are selling the most?

### Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The sales trend is influenced by strong seasonal variations. Sales tend to increase during certain months, typically coinciding with holidays or special promotions. Conversely, there are months where sales dip, like the month of June, reflecting a seasonal drop in demand.
2. Product30 and Product41 emerged as top performers, contributing significantly to overall sales, while category product06 lagged behind.
3. High-value customers in Western and East Region were responsible for a substantial portion of total sales, suggesting the importance of targeting these segments.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Continue to focus on high-value customers in Western and East Region, offering personalized incentives, loyalty programs, and special promotions to retain and attract more of these valuable customers.
- Make use of the seasonality insights to plan inventory, marketing campaigns, and sales strategies that align with peak demand during specific months.
- Focus on expanding and promoting product06.

### Limitations
The dataset does not include specific information on distribution channels. Therefore, recommendations in this area are not as precise as they could be with channel-specific data.
